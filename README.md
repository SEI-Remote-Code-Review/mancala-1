This is a browser-based game of Mancala. I decided to build this game because it reminded me of my time spent living in Alaska- fall colors, mountains, stained glass windows, and MANCALA. 

## Check It Out

Grab a friend (or an enemy) and decide who will be Player One and who will be Player Two. If your chosen opponent has never experienced Mancala before, I have graciously provided a "What Are The Rules" section on the page to peruse.  

Here is a link to my deployed game:

## Next Steps

### Marble Work
- Have four differently colored marbles that randomly place themselves.

- Add an animation with specific time intervals to actually accomplish "seeing" the marbles move one-by-one, rather than an instant movement on a click. 

- Allow for the marbles to "layer" after a certain amount are in each hole. 

### Browser Compatibility
- Implement support for smartphone/tablet game play
- Responsiveness to browser size changes

### Misc.
- A nicer win modal
