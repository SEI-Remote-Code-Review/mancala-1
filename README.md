# **Mancala**



This is a browser-based game of Mancala blah blah...

## Check It Out

Grab a friend (or an enemy) and decide who will be Player One and who will be Player Two. If your chosen opponent has never experienced Mancala before, I have graciously provided a "What Are The Rules" section on the page to peruse.  

Here is a link to my deployed game:

## The Process

- include pictures of wireframe/describe process/etc.


## Next Steps

### Marble Animation:

Something that makes Mancala so meditative is the physical act of distibuting marbles one-by-one. This provides a sense of tempo and rhythm that I feel is lost in a browser based version. Therefore, I would like to add an animation with specific time intervals to actually accomplish "seeing" the marbles move one-by-one, rather than an instant movement on a click. 

### Marble Layers:
As the game continues, marbles begin to pile up in each hole. Right now, I have the physical representaion of marbles capped off at eight. So I would like to write some code that allows for the marbles to "layer" after a certain amount are in each hole.
